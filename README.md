# Kubernetes Cluster

Here is a kubernetes cluster module for terraform (to run on AWS).

## Requirements

* VPC
* S3 Endpoint
* Route53 Host Zone
* Access to private subnets

## References

In order to write the module I've been inspired by 
[Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) from 
[Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower) and 
[Kubernetes: Getting Started with CoreOS](https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/getting-started.html)
